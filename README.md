# CNN-Image-Classifier

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on what's in the notebook). The goal is to perform image classification using a CNN model.

# Features

- CNN model architecture for image classification
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training metrics
- Prediction and result visualization
